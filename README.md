For help with the theme, see [minimal-mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/). This is also accessible from the local blog (http://127.0.0.1:4000/theme-setup/).

Because this theme uses ruby gems to do things like code syntax hightlighting, you will need to serve it using

    bundle exec jekyll serve

rather than the normal

    jekyll serve
