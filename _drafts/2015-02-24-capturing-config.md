#Capturing Drupal Config

My [previous post](http://tombola.github.io/drupal/making-a-drupal-distribution/) describes the whys and wherefores.

I mentioned in another post that I wanted to test an install profile on the same codebase as an existing dev site using drupal [multisites](/drupal/making-a-drupal-distribution/#multisite) to separate the databases. As a side note, this caused me some issues with my desired workflow, which was to use an [unattended](/drupal/making-a-drupal-distribution/#unattended) install. I shouldn't imagine this would give anyone else sleepless nights, so I will gloss over it, though here is my [solution](/drupal/2015-02-24-unattended-multisite/) if you are interested.
